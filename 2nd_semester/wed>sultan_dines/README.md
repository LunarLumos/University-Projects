Project    : Sultan’s Dine – Catering Website

--------------------------------------------
📦 Project Description
--------------------------------------------

This project is a practical implementation of a responsive, multi-section  
catering service website titled **Sultan’s Dine**, developed using core  
web development technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website is designed to represent a real-world catering business and  
includes several interactive and user-friendly features such as:
  - A dynamic hero image slider  
  - Categorized event-based menu system  
  - Responsive image gallery  
  - Testimonial carousel  
  - Contact and booking form with validation  
  - Sticky navigation and scroll-to-top button  

The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate my ability to apply  
front-end development concepts learned in class, including page structure,  
responsive design, user interface behavior, and client-side scripting.

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of semantic markup,  
modular CSS, and DOM manipulation, and practiced translating design  
requirements into a fully functional web interface.
